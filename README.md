# About Requestly
Requestly is a set of tools (browser extensions and desktop apps) that supercharges your web development. Requestly allows you to modify network (HTTP/S) requests by setting up "Rules" for redirects, modifying headers, switching hosts, inserting user scripts, cancelling requests and modifying AJAX response. 
Requestly also offers a library service which allows you to upload and host JS/CSS files with direct links to ease dubugging process. These files can also be used directly inside Rules with a single click.

# Why Requestly
### Easy Interface
Primarily designed for web developers – Requestly enables easy debugging of remote & external scripts using simple Redirect & Script Rules.
### Files Library

Requestly allows uploading, creating and managing js, css, json etc files which can be used in Requestly rules. No need to setup local server now.
### Regex Support

Requestly has rich interface to provide url matching conditions. Multiple Operators are supported – Equals, Contains, Regex (Matches) and Regex with wildcard too.
### AutoSync in Chrome

Requestly rules are stored in Chrome sync storage so even if you change your device, when you login to chrome you will get back your rules.
### Multi Browser

Requestly is available for Chrome & Firefox. We intend to support Edge & Opera in near future. Debugging cross browser issues is lot more easier.
### Backup & Share

Requestly allows you to download rules as text file. You can also share a list of rules by generating a public url and providing that to other users.
# Features
## Modify Request URL
Requestly allows you to modify the url of ongoing request and you can change the url to something else. Common examples include:
- Setting up Redirects (eg, facebook.com -> quora.com) 
- Creating URL shortcuts (e.g. Type j-1 in address bar will open jira.corp.example.com/projects/jira-1).
- Switching Hosts (All requests for xyz.com should go to abc.com)
- Block websites (e.g. Block social media websites to stay productive)
- Modify some part of URL (be it host, path, query parameters etc)
- Stay way from time killing sites. Setup rules like when source contains facebook.com or twitter.com then redirect to StackOverflow and do some geeky stuff.
- Test your JS running in production environment. Simply redirect your JS from prod to JS from your local setup box and test if your fix/code actually works in production site.
## Insert Custom Scripts
- Run scripts on website and customize the web pages you want
- Support your script with popular libraries like jQuery and underscore.
- Use FileHosting service to upload long scripts and get a URL to be used in your websites or Requestly rules
- Very similar to GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey user scripts
## Host JS/CSS Files
Use Library Service to host JS/CSS Files and use the URLs inside Requestly rules. No need to setup local server.
## Modify Headers
Modify HTTP Request & Response headers. (Extremely helpful for web developers for debugging applications)
## Modify User Agent
- Setup different user agents for websites and test how they behave
- Useful for web developers for testing cross-device compatibility
## Modify AJAX Response
Use Modify AJAX Response Rule to define custom response to AJAX requests initiated by browser.

# Additional Features
- Deactivate the extension when you don't need it.
- Enable/Disable the rules with just single click
- Export and import the rules and maintain a backup for your rules (They are important, you will know)
- Share Rules with other Users in one click
- Browser Sync is enabled so you create/change your rules in one browser and the changes will automatically be reflected in another.
 
Additionally, Requestly provides a very user friendly interface to setup your rules. You can toggle a rule with a single click. No need to delete a rule when you don't need it. Just make that inactive and activate it later whenever you need it again.
