- ### Easy Interface 👨‍💻

  Primarily designed for web developers – Requestly enables easy debugging of remote & external scripts using simple Redirect & Script Rules.

- ### Files Library 🗃

  Requestly allows uploading, creating and managing js, css, json etc files which can be used in Requestly rules. No need to setup local server now.

- ### Regex Support 💬

  Requestly has rich interface to provide url matching conditions. Multiple Operators are supported – Equals, Contains, Regex (Matches) and Regex with wildcard too.

- ### AutoSync in Chrome 👯

  Requestly rules are stored in Chrome sync storage so even if you change your device, when you login to chrome you will get back your rules.

- ### Multi Browser 💻

  Requestly is available for Chrome & Firefox. We intend to support Edge & Opera in near future. Debugging cross browser issues is lot more easier.

- ### Backup & Share ⬇

  Requestly allows you to download rules as text file. You can also share a list of rules by generating a public url and providing that to other users.

# Features ✨

### 🌐 Modify Request URL

Requestly allows you to modify the url of ongoing request and you can change the url to something else. Common examples include:

- Setting up Redirects (eg, facebook.com -> quora.com)
- Creating URL shortcuts (e.g. Type j-1 in address bar will open jira.corp.example.com/projects/jira-1).
- Switching Hosts (All requests for xyz.com should go to abc.com)
- Block websites (e.g. Block social media websites to stay productive)
- Modify some part of URL (be it host, path, query parameters etc)
- Stay way from time killing sites. Setup rules like when source contains facebook.com or twitter.com then redirect to StackOverflow and do some geeky stuff.
- Test your JS running in production environment. Simply redirect your JS from prod to JS from your local setup box and test if your fix/code actually works in production site.

### 📜 Insert Custom Scripts

- Run scripts on website and customize the web pages you want
- Support your script with popular libraries like jQuery and underscore.
- Use FileHosting service to upload long scripts and get a URL to be used in your websites or Requestly rules
- Very similar to GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey user scripts

### 🧮 Host JS/CSS Files

Use Library Service to host JS/CSS Files and use the URLs inside Requestly rules. No need to setup local server.

### 🎬 Modify Headers

Modify HTTP Request & Response headers. (Extremely helpful for web developers for debugging applications)

### 🕴 Modify User Agent

- Setup different user agents for websites and test how they behave
- Useful for web developers for testing cross-device compatibility

### 📱 Modify AJAX Response

Use Modify AJAX Response Rule to define custom response to AJAX requests initiated by browser.

# Additional Features ➕

- Deactivate the extension when you don't need it.
- Enable/Disable the rules with just single click
- Export and import the rules and maintain a backup for your rules (They are important, you will know)
- Share Rules with other Users in one click
- Browser Sync is enabled so you create/change your rules in one browser and the changes will automatically be reflected in another.

Additionally, Requestly provides a very user friendly interface to setup your rules. You can toggle a rule with a **single click**. No need to delete a rule when you don't need it. Just make that inactive and activate it later whenever you need it again.
